# CodeBreaker
Simple code-breaking game in Delphi

Written in Borland Delphi somewhere back at high school.

- Your task is to put in correct 4-digits code
- You have 10 attempts and a time limit
- You'll get color hints - green = (some) digit is correct, yellow = correct digit in wrong place, red = completely wrong
- Best scorers for fastest and most accurate breakers are tracked

The repository was just restored from an old backup (2006-12-16) without any pruning or maintaining the code.

I don't plan to work on this program any further...
